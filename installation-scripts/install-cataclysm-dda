# Tiles are so sloooooooow, ncurses are 5-10 times faster. So you better download ncurses which are nicer, have better fonts etc and just use quick zoom out as a minimap when you are walking long distances. Note: quick zoom in and zoom out is imposible in `tiles` version as it is slooooow
## No, really, I tried&tested it, tiles are 5 times slower, they are annoying to play, even if your tiles are the text. But with curses you can really zoom out crazily! And even with this zoom out your movement is fast and there is no hiccups/clowdowns, therefore the minimap is simply not needed! Zoom in/out: ctrl-shift-PgDn/PgUp, it seems to be working in `st` though I can't find it in code.
### BE SURE to download&compile vanilla `st` without any of your patches and configs:
#### Colours are way more bright and pleasant
#### The font is much more rectangular
